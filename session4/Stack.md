Stack Data Structure

    - Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
    - The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
    - Mainly the following three basic operations are performed in the stack:

        - Push: Adds an item in the stack.
        - Pop: Removes an item from the stack.
        - Peek or Top: Returns top element of stack.
        - isEmpty: Returns true if stack is empty, else false.

    stack overflow: when stack is full and we try to push an element into it.
    stack underflow: when stack is empty and we try to pop an element from it.

    - Stack can be implemented using array or linked list.
